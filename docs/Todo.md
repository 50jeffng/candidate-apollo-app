# Todo
*(\* = Missing Features from given requirement)*
* Update*: By a form that has filled out fields from the data we've chosen to update
* Pagination*: Home displaying our models should be paginated (limited), with gestures or buttons to navigate to the next page, also maybe the limit can be set in a settings page
* Filtering & Searching*: The now useless search bar should be able to search data as the user types, it could query from name & description via Apollo GraphQL's lazy query
* Candidate has list of skills: Initially I wanted this
* Add skills to candidate: Probably using an Input component with filtering & searching, suggesting Skills in the database as you type
* Overview page: That states number of models, how many Candidates are not hired etc.
* Settings page: To configure dark mode and some preference
* Change Skill's home page tiles picture from placeholder to show related skill's picture (probably need to store images in database, but that's for another day)
