# candidate-apollo-app ðŸ¤µ

candidate-apollo-app is a simple CRUD (Create Read Update Delete) capable mobile app powered by [React Native] with [Apollo GraphQL] x [Express] as backend server and [MongoDB] x [mongoose] as database.
(aka [MERN] stack)

It's essentially two applications:
  - Frontend mobile app (`./client`)
  - Backend server (`./server`)

### Documentation
You can find the docs (like app structure, features and notes) at `./docs`

### Installation

candidate-apollo-app requires [Node.js] and a mobile phone or emulator (preferably Android) to run.

Run `start_project.bat` if you're using Windows, or open your favorite Terminal and run these commands. (every terminal is starting from root directory!)
> Before running `start_project.bat` be sure to create `mongodb_path.txt` that contains the directory of your MongoDB database in the first line

Start up MongoDB:
```sh
$ mongod --dbpath="path"
```

Server:
```sh
$ cd server
$ npm run start
```

Client First Terminal:
```sh
$ cd client
$ yarn start
```

Client Second Terminal:
```sh
$ cd client
$ npx react-native run-android/run-ios
```

(optional) If you're running on an Android emulator:
```sh
$ cd client
$ adb reverse tcp:8080 tcp:8080
```
> Note that the server uses port 8080!


### Development

Want to contribute? Great! But we are not currently accepting any contributors as this is a short-sighted program requested by a company for me to test my programming prowessness!

Just fork it if you want!

### Background & Thoughts
I graduated near the end of [2020] with a neat Computer Science degree from [Monash University]. So I do what most fresh grads do, I apply to jobs. And one company requested me to write a test project (CRUD) with the technologies listed above (except the database, they allowed me to choose what to use), all within a week. I didn't know most of these techs (it was on purpose by them :o). I really only knew [React] at the time, and have just learned how to use [Express] three days prior. Also, I have spent the first two days configuring the project and learning the basics as I go. Naturally I am worried and stressed, so I went more spaghettier than I would have liked in terms of writing code. But at least I have learned much from this exprience!

Time taken: 7 days (23th December 2020 - 30th December 2020)

### Acknowledgement
[LavaX] for forcing me to learn faster.
